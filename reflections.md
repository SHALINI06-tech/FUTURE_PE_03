This task taught me how powerful prompt engineering can be in controlling tone, purpose, and outcome. Each tool had its strengths:
- ChatGPT was best for versatility.
- Blackbox AI provided fast iterations.
- Copy.ai was perfect for marketing-specific copy.

Understanding how to frame a prompt was more valuable than I expected—it’s like setting the stage for creativity.
